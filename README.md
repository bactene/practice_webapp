These scripts use jquery-ui 1.12.0 (http://jqueryui.com)

known issues:
  1) The layout in the jquery enhanced version may not work well on small screens
  2) Presence/absence of application icons is saved, but the sort order of the jquery enhanced version is not saved.
  3) Changes made after the cookie times out are not preserved, nor do they prompt for a login.
